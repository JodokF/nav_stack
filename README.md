# Read Me

see `Set-up & Installation Guids.md` in the `docs` directory. 

The best way to read the docs is with the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) since it supports the linking to other files in the doc. 

Just download Obsidian and open the `docs` directory as an Obsidian *"vault"*. 

But you can also just read them with any other markdown-compatible application, or directly on git-hub.
