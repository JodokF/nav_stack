## changed paremeters for horizontal velocity:
- `MPC_HOLD_MAX_XY` to 0.4 -> idk back to 0.8 (= default)
- `MC_PITCHRATE_MAX` to 55 -> not gooood!!! -> back to default
- `MPC_VEL_MANUAL` can't be reduce!?? why? 
- `MPC_XY_MAN_EXPO` not changed but maybe intresting

---
- **`MPC_XY_VEL_ALL` to 1 -> I think that's it -> reduced it even more to 0.8**

---

### for the vertical velocity:
- `MPC_Z_VEL_ALL` to 1.5 -> not bad but descents too quick so -> set to -1 -> idk ... let it that way
