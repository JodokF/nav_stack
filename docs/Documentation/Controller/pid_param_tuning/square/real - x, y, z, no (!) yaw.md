## Square:
flying the square, without any yaw rotation

## 1. Test:
-> same values as with rotation, yaw values don't matter...
action...

## 2. Test:
-> reducing kp_z, raising kp_x and kp_y
action...
-> forgot to make screenshots
-> but kp_x and kp_y maybe still to low and kp_z too high

| Gain  |     | X    |     | Y    |     | Z     |     | ~~YAW~~   |

FUUUUCK closed RVIZ to early! üò© 



## 3. Test:
-> even more: reducing kp_z, raising kp_x and kp_y
action...
-> not too bad actually, kp_z maybe too low, maybe adding ki_x/y 


| Gain  |     | X      |     | Y     |     | Z    |     | ~~YAW~~   |

## 4. Test:
-> even more: reducing kp_z, raising kp_x and kp_y, adding ki_x/y 
action...
-> ??? no idea, maybe make some rosbags to compare it better with PLOTJUGGLER!

## 8. Test:
-> going into the other direction as before raising k reducing i -> only for z
action...
-> jesus fuck idk, I think tweaking the PID parameters does not really help at this point any more
