## 1. Test:

| Gain|     | X   |     |  Y  |     |  Z  |     | YAW |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|$K_p$|     |0.01 |     | 0.01|     |0.035|     | 0.01|

## 2. Test:

- added a little bit of i gain in yaw
- stayed almost the same

| Gain|     | X   |     |  Y  |     |  Z  |     | YAW |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|$K_p$|     |0.01 |     | 0.01|     |0.035|     | 0.01|
|$K_i$|     |0.004|     |0.004|     |0.015|     |0.005|
|$K_d$|     |0.0005|    |0.0005|    |0.001|     |  0  |
